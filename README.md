# SideBySide
_A cross-platform command-line tool (Windows, Linux, macOS) for combining two portrait photos into a single landscape image. This is useful for digital photo frames that display vertical images awkwardly._

## üß∞ Features
* üíª Runs on Windows, Linux (x64 & ARM) and macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon).
* üñºÔ∏è Combines two portrait `.jpg` images into one seamless landscape `.jpg`.
* ‚ûñ Adds an optional separator between images to enhance visual separation.
* üéØ Automatically centers each photo within a black background.
* üìê Resizes output to optimally fit digital photo frame displays.
* üîê Creates uniquely named files to prevent duplicates and maintain consistency.
* üîÄ Supports sorting photos by date taken/created or random order

## üöÄ Quick start guide

To do

## üíª Command line options

```
SideBySide <source dir> <destination dir> <output dimensions> <separator width> [options]
```

### Mandatory arguments

- **`<source dir>`**   
  Source directory containing `.jpg` or `.jpeg` images. Any images that aren't portrait will be ignored.

- **`<destination dir>`**   
  Destination directory for the generated landscape images. This directory must exist.

- **`<output dimensions>`**   
  The dimensions of the output image required in the format `[width]x[height]`. The width must be greater than the height.

>[!TIP]
>For the best results, set the output dimensions to the resolution of your digital photo frame.

- **`<seperator width>`**   
  The minimum size (in pixels) of the black seperator between the two images. Set this to `0` if you want the images to potentially touch each other.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Black borders (to the left and right) will naturally appear depending on the aspect ratio of the images being sized. This option defines the _minimum_ number of pixels between two images.

### Optional arguments

- **`-v`, `--verbose`**   
  Output additional information to the screen to aid in debugging. This information is always included in the logs.

- **`-o`, `--overwrite`**   
  Overwrite any files with the same name already in the destination folder. By default, they will be skipped.

- **`-d`, `--delete`**   
  Delete all images generated by SideBySide (with the pattern `sideby-*.jpg`) in the destination folder before starting.

- **`-r`, `--random`**   
  Randomly order the photos rather than by date taken.

- **`/?`, `-h`, `--help`**  
  Displays the full help text with all available options, credits and the location of the log files.

## üß© How output files are generated

Each output file is uniquely named based on the two source image paths using a short, URL-safe SHA256 hash. For example:
```
sideby-Z9dcF2gqex7o7RGn.jpg
```
The name will always be the same for the same pair of images, even if run multiple times.

Changing the seperator width will not change the name. If you change the seperator width then you will need to use `--overwrite` to force the files to be overwritten.
