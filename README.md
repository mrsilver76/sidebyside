# SideBySide
_A cross-platform command-line tool (Windows, Linux, macOS) for combining two portrait photos into a single landscape image. This is useful for digital photo frames that display vertical images awkwardly._

## üñºÔ∏è Framing the problem

Many digital photo frames are designed with landscape orientation in mind.

When they encounter portrait images, they often resort to awkward workarounds - adding black bars to the sides (_pillarboxing_) or cropping the top and bottom to fill the frame. Both approaches compromise the photo: either by shrinking it down to an underwhelming size or by cutting out important parts of the image. For users who care about presentation, this default behaviour can feel unsatisfying and unpolished.

SideBySide works around this problem by combining two portrait images into a single landscape composition. The pairing is automatic, the layout balanced and the final resolution tailored to your display. Because the output matches your frame‚Äôs aspect ratio exactly, each image appears larger and sharper - making better use of the available screen.

The result is a photo frame that feels curated - not cluttered or compromised.

## üß∞ Features
* üíª Runs on Windows, Linux (x64 & ARM) and macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon).
* üñºÔ∏è Combines two portrait `.jpg` images into one seamless landscape `.jpg`.
* ‚ûñ Adds an optional divider to enhance visual separation between images.
* üéØ Automatically centers each photo within a black background.
* üìê Resizes output to optimally fit digital photo frame displays.
* üîê Creates uniquely named files to prevent duplicates and maintain consistency.
* üîÄ Supports sorting photos by date taken/created or random order.
* üï∞Ô∏è Preserves original timestamps (when sorted).

### Linux/macOS users

* You will need to install the [.NET 8.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime).
* Don't forget to make the file executable: `chmod +x SideBySide-x.x.x-<your-platform>`

### Platform testing notes

* Tested extensively: Windows 11
* Tested moderately: Linux (ARM)
* Not tested at all: Windows 10, Linux (x64), macOS (x64 & Apple Silicon)

## üöÄ Quick start guide

Here is an example for using SideBySide. It will work on all platforms.

```
SideBySide "C:\Users\Richard\Pictures\Holiday" "C:\Users\Richard\Pictures\Frame" 1080x720 12 -d

SideBySide "~/Pictures/Holiday" "~/Pictures/Frame" 1080x720 12 --delete
```
* Look for portrait images in the `Pictures\Holiday` home folder
* Output landscapes images in the `Pictures\Frame` home folder
* Delete previously generated images in `Pictures\Frame` before starting
* All landscape images to be 1080 x 720
* Use a 12 pixel separator (where necessary)


## üíª Command line options

```
SideBySide <source dir> <destination dir> <output dimensions> <separator width> [options]
```

### Mandatory arguments

- **`<source dir>`**   
  Directory containing portrait `.jpg` or `.jpeg` images. Landscape or square images will be ignored.

- **`<destination dir>`**   
  Directory where generated landscape images will be saved. Must already exist.

- **`<output dimensions>`**   
  Output image dimensions specified as `[width]x[height]` (e.g. `1080x720`).

>[!TIP]
>For optimal display quality, set the output dimensions to match the native resolution of your digital photo frame. This ensures images are scaled accurately without distortion or unnecessary padding.

- **`<seperator width>`**   
  Minimum width in pixels of the black separator between images. Set to `0` to avoid adding extra separation.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Black borders on the left and right may appear depending on the aspect ratio of the original images. The separator width defines the _minimum_ number of pixels placed between the two images. If natural spacing already exceeds this value due to image proportions, no additional separator will be added.

### Optional arguments

- **`-v`, `--verbose`**   
  Enables detailed logging output for debugging and progress tracking. This information is always included in the logs.

- **`-o`, `--overwrite`**   
  Overwrite existing output images if they already exist in the destination directory.

- **`-d`, `--delete`**   
  Remove all generated images from the destination folder before processing begins. Only `.jpg` files with names starting with `sideby-` will be deleted.

- **`-r`, `--random`**   
  Randomise the order of input images instead of sorting by date taken/created. When enabled, the output images will have their creation and modification timestamps set to the time of processing rather than preserving the originals.

- **`/?`, `-h`, `--help`**  
  Displays the full help text with all available options, credits and the location of the log files.

## üßæ Output file naming and timestamp behavour

Each generated file is uniquely named using a short SHA256 hash derived from the full paths of the two source images.

For example:
```
sideby-Z9dcF2gqex7o7RGn.jpg
```
The filename is deterministic: given the same pair of input files, the output name will always be the same - regardless of options like separator width or output resolution. This ensures consistency across runs and avoids unnecessary duplication.

>[!NOTE]
>By default, the tool will not overwrite existing files. If you change visual settings and want updated images, use the `--overwrite` flag to force regeneration.

When images are sorted by date (default), the output file‚Äôs creation and modification times are set to the earliest of the two input images. When using `--random`, timestamps are not modified to avoid implying an artificial order.
